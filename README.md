I use each day as an opportunity to improve, create, and thrive. As a natural problem solver and planning extraordinaire, Iâ€™m naturally looking for ways to enhance already established programs, or even blaze a new trail to turn a new thought into something tangible and useful! As a technology-centered educator/coach, I have used a wide variety of web-based services to meet and enhance the individual learning needs of my students and athletes. I have had a passion for technology for as long as I can remember and can first-hand attest to how powerful it is in creating your own narrative. Iâ€™ve taken the initiative to learn the necessary technical skills for implementing and creating applications to better serve the community at large. I am a junior-level software engineer seeking full-time employment opportunities in front-end, back-end, or full-stack web development.
